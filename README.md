# What is Yellow Ticket?
## share more, waste less..
I thought of the idea for Yellow Ticket before starting my journey at Le Wagon's bootcamp. It is a web application that allows local store owners to list food & drink items at a reduced price or even for free!! The aim is to reduce food waste one bite at a time.. 

Owners will list surplus or close to expiry stock that would normally be sunk costs and customers can search for stores in the area and see which of their favourite items have become available ü•ê‚òïÔ∏è

## Getting Started:
Navigate to: "https://yellow-ticket.com"
